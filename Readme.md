## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

_The Instruction for installing and set up the project locally._

### Quick Installation

1.1. Before running the code examples, we have to clone the repository to your local machine:

* Git Clone: Clone the repository to your local machine:
  
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NolanMM/Azure_AI_Recognizer_Project.git
  ```

1.2. Before running the code examples, make sure you have dependencies installed:

* Install dependencies using pip package:
  
  ```bash
    pip install AI-ML-Formulas-Recognizer-Extraction==1.0
  ```
  
1.3. Run the server

* Run the server:
  
  ```bash
    python main.py
  ```
  
* Run the client:
  
  ```bash
    python client.py
  ```
  
### Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

2.1. Before running the code examples, make sure you have the virtual enviroment is installed and be ready to use:
We need to create a new `Python 3.11` / `Python 3.10` virtual enviroment for this project.

* If you want to create a new virtual enviroment, you can use the following command in the terminal of the project directory:

  * In Windows or Linux, you can use the following command:
  
  ```bash
    python -m venv venv
  ```

  * Then, you can activate the virtual enviroment by using the following command:
  
  ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  * In MacOs, you can use the following command:
  
  ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
  ```

  * Then, you can activate the virtual enviroment by using the following command:
  
  ```bash
    source venv/Scripts/activate
  ```

* Make sure the virtual environment needed for project is activate with corresponding project directory, you can use the following command:

  * In Windows or Linux, you can use the following command:
  
  ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

  * In MacOs, you can use the following command:
  
  ```bash
    source venv/Scripts/activate
  ```

* Option 1: Install dependencies using pip package:
  
  ```bash
    pip install AI-ML-Formulas-Recognizer-Extraction==1.0
  ```
  
* Option 2: Install requirements.txt: Automatically installed dependencies that needed for the project:
  
  ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
